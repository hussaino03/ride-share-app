## Inspiration

Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things

## What it does
An app that allows the user to calculate their trip budget, and also displays a customized dashboard for the driver and passenger. A passenger is prompted to enter their details such as location, and a map gets displayed which shows the total distance and other features for ease of accessibility. Moreover, the driver dashboard is there to make the process of collecting payments more efficient and easy. The driver can simply login to their account and see the passengers they currently need to pick-up or see the total fares as well.

The app can display the required information for both the passenger and driver with a simple click, while also giving them more utilities such as budget planning. 

## How we built it
We used MERN(Mongo,Express,React,Node) for building this project.We used Google Map API and Stripe API for the payment portal. 

## Challenges we ran into
We were new to Google Map API and we had a lot of problems figuring out the exact key features which we needed for working on the application. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to contribute to the project on right time even though we were from various timezones .

## What we learned
We learned how to work more as a team and we learnt our mistakes from each other . We were able to gain more knowledge from each one of them and we were able to learn many new stuffs about Google Maps API

## What's next for ReNew
We want to perfect the Budget Planner component but we were able to do the features which we had planned. We can make the Budget Planner more accurate and we can add notifications feature. We want to scale it to a mobile app as well and launch as a start up as a collective group. We hope to talk with our local newspaper to spread publicity about this to get people to use our platform
